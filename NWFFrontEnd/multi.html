										<h4>Field Operations</h4>
										<blockquote>We help develop the infrastructure required to conduct field work like canvassing, phone banking, and text banking using data from the voter database and provide team members from our staff to help directly conduct these operations. If you have mailers that need to be packaged, lawn signs that need to be distributed, emails that need to be sent, a social media presence that needs to be created, or any other campaign literature needs, our team can handle it.

</blockquote>

                    <h4>Volunteer Base Development</h4>
                    <blockquote>Volunteer Base Development: One of our specialities is volunteer base development. We use our contacts with school counselors to build a robust base of youth volunteers to your specifications. We can also handle training and turf assignments for field outreach. For multi-county campaigns we will try to build a reliable 40-50 person voulenteer team comprised primarily of young people.



</blockquote>

                    <h4>Fundraising</h4>
                    <blockquote>Fundraising: We provide number vetting and donor research services to maximize effectiveness. Additionally, we provide logistic support for fundraising events along with follow through service for potential donors.

</blockquote>

                    <h4>Message Consulting</h4>
                    <blockquote>Message Consulting: We analyze campaign messaging and gauge its effectiveness. We use previous election data, demographic information, and the key issues of the race to not only determine what campaign messages resonate best with voters, but also how different campaign themes affect different groups of voters. The precision of our method allows voter communication to be much more effective.

</blockquote>

                    <h4>Strategic Consulting</h4>
                    <blockquote>Strategic Consulting: Our team understands that their are different factions and coalitions at play in multi-county races, and thus we will utilize our current body of research to create a full outreach strategy outline for our clients. This outreach strategy will include: analysis of demographic groups and areas most likely to support our client, a list of community leaders and officials who are influential in the key communities, a list of leaders and communities alienated by other candidates, and any other information relevant to our clientâ€™s campaign. With our outline, we will also provide endorsement outreach to facilitate introductions with local leaders and provide in-depth background research on them to increase effectiveness.
